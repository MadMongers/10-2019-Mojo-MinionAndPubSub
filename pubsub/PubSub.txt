PubSub is socket orientated
If listeners are not up, messages are lost. Think /dev/null
Pg and mysql. SQLite is deprecated

Crank up 2 listeners. Note: pubsub5r.pl and pubsub6r.pl are the same program.
Why, $0 is part of the output
$ perl pubsub5r.pl &
$ perl pubsub6r.pl &

In a different window
Send messages 
$ perl pubsubs.pl

And watch the output from the listener(s)/receiver(s)
