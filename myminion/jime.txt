I choose not to put Task in a Mojolicious Task Library
because I did NOT want to use Mojolicious::Lite
Just Minion!

My tasks are locate in ~/lib/MyTasks.pm

I wanted to show how to name the queue your jobs
are submitted to, 'notdefault' ;-)

Submit 2 jobs (tasks 'Bob1' and 'Bob2') 
$ perl ../awb/submit.pl

Job Dependencies
Submit 3 jobs (tasks 'Bob1' and 'Longbob2' are parents, and must complete before
task 'pack' [child] then will execute)
$ perl ../awb/submit_pack.pl
