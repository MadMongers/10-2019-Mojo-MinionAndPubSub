                                  Mojo's Publish and Subscribe

     If listeners are not up, messages are lost. Think /dev/null
     Pg and mysql. SQLite is deprecated

     Crank up 2 listeners. Note: pubsub5r.pl and pubsub6r.pl are the same program.
     Why, $0 is part of the output
     $ perl pubsub5r.pl &
     $ perl pubsub6r.pl &

     Send messages
     $ perl pubsubs.pl

     And watch the output from the listener(s)/receiver(s)
