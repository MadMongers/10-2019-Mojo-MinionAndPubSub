== Starting Place for Minion

Mojolicious Advent Calendar 2018 Day 10
Minion Stands Alone by Doug Bell (preaction)

He created a task called 'check_url' to check how long it takes to 
download a URL (mojolicious.org)

He does not declare a queue name for his jobs so they
go to a queue named 'default'

Note: In his command line examples where he uses 'myapp.pl', it
      should be 'minion.pl'
