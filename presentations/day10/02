     Mojolicious Advent Calendar 2018 Day 10
     Minion Stands Alone by Doug Bell (preaction)

     He created a task called 'check_url' to check how long it takes to
     download a URL (mojolicious.org)

     He does not declare a queue name for his jobs so they
     go to a queue named 'default'

     Note: In his command line examples where he uses 'myapp.pl', it
           should be 'minion.pl'
