     I put 'tasks' in a Mojolicious Task Library. See Minion POD -> Growing

     My tasks are locate in {PROJECT}/lib/AWB/Task/{TASKS}.pm

     I wanted to show how to name the queue your jobs are submitted to, 'notdefault' ;-)

     Submit 2 jobs (tasks 'Bob1' and 'Bob2')

     view ../../myminion/submit.pl
     -
     $ perl submit.pl
