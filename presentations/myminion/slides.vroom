My Minion Stuff -- Part 2

This presentation is using Ingy dÃ¶t Net's Vroom

== Jim's Stuff

I put 'tasks' in a Mojolicious Task Library. See Minion POD -> Growing

+My tasks are locate in {PROJECT}/lib/AWB/Task/{TASKS}.pm

+I wanted to show how to name the queue your jobs are submitted to, 'notdefault' ;-)

+Submit 2 jobs (tasks 'Bob1' and 'Bob2') 

+view ../../myminion/submit.pl
+-
+$ perl submit.pl
----
== Job Dependencies

Submit 3 jobs (tasks 'Bob1' and 'Longbob2' are parents, and must complete before
task 'Pack' [child] then will execute)

+view ../../myminion/submit_pack.pl
+-
+$ perl submit_pack.pl
----
== Working in a Job(coal) Mine

view ../../myminion/worker.pl
+-
+Run a worker

$ perl minion.pl minion worker -q default
or
$ bash start_worker.sh   # created by jime

perl worker.pl minion worker -q notdefault -q default
